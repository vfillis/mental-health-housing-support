# The available housing support in mental health services

**["My basic needs were not met at all" — thousands of mental health patients experiencing homelessness](https://vfillis.github.io/html/mental-health-and-housing.html)**

Data obtained through Freedom of Information revealed that at the end of January 2021, 10,183 people in contact with mental health services were experiencing homelessness. 

At the same time, only a third of NHS trusts employs specialist housing support staff in their mental health inpatient and community settings. 

The investigation revealed how a hospital stay can lead to homelessness, the effects it has on those with mental illness, and why it’s often difficult to find new and suitable accommodation.
