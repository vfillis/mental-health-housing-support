FOI ref: 2021/0295

Further to your email below, I can now respond to your request dated 4th March 2021.

Following receipt of your request, searches were conducted within Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust (the Trust) to locate the requested information and I can confirm that some of the information requested is held by the Trust:

Please see the Trust response to questions one and two in the attached.

With regards the total number of people in adult mental health services who are on Section 117 Aftercare, the Trust does not hold this information.

Mental health after-care services are jointly provided or commissioned by local authorities and CCGs, who will both maintain a record of people for whom they provide or commission after-care and what after-care services are provided therefore we are unable to provide this information.

Yours sincerely
