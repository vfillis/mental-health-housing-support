## My reply

Hello,

Thank you for your email. I have a question regarding your confirmation that Lincolnshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust is not holding information relating to adult mental health patients’ accommodation status.  

In the monthly [Mental Health Services Monthly Statistics data set](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/mental-health-services-monthly-statistics), there are measures that include information about the accommodation type of patients. For example, AMH14 says how many patients on CPA are living in settled accommodation. 

I was wondering what information this measure is based on. Don’t you need to know the accommodation status of the patients to say how many are living in settled accommodation each month? 

Thank you very much,
Vanessa Fillis

Dear Vanessa
 
Thank you for your email.
 
I do apologise; we misunderstood your request, which has now been further clarified as a result of your latest email. Please find attached the data for your first two questions. I can however confirm that the accommodation data for patients receiving s.117 MHA 1983 Aftercare is not held by Lincolnshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. In accordance with the Trust’s obligation to be as helpful as possible, I can suggest that this information may be held by Lincolnshire Clinical Commissioning Group and their FOI Team can be contacted at agcsu.foi.lincs@nhs.net
