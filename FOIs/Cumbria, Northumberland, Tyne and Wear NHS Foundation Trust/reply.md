We have provided, as at month end, the number of referrals open to in-scope teams (those with a MHSDS service/team type of “General Mental Health Services”, excluding CYPS teams) and the client’s latest accommodation status as at month end. We have then provided, of those, the number on Enhanced CPA as at month end.  We are unable to answer question 3 as the Trust does not hold information on clients who are currently subject to a Section 117 – this information, or register, may be held by the local authority/authorities in question.
