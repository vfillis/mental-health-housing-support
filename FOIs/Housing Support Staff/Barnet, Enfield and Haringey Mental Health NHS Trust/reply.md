Dear Ms Fillis,

Please find attached and below the response to your FOI request of 7 April.

Please find attached the discharge and transfer policy for the Trust which includes reference to discharging homeless patients.
Although our staff do support people to find accommodation, this is often by working in partnership with other agencies rather than by employing staff in specific roles as housing officers, housing support workers, housing nurses etc either in inpatient settings or in the community so we are unable to quantify this.

Kind regards
