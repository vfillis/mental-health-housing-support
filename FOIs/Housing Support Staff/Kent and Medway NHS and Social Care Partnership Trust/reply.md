Staff members supporting homeless clients

Following an investigation and search of our records I can confirm the following Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust (KMPT) information:-

1.The number of nurses or support workers who support patients regarding their housing while they are inpatient in a mental health unit. These could be housing officers, housing support workers, special housing nurses, or similar professions that are specialised in housing support.

All information requested is not routinely collected outside normal record keeping of an personnel File. The requested information is not held centrally and is contained within the individual personnel files and archive systems which can not be extracted as a stand alone piece of data.

2.The protocol for discharging homeless patients or patients who face homelessness after their discharge. Please provide a document with the discharge policy or, if there is no document, please state what the protocol is.
I can confirm KMPT do not have a specific document or policy however protocol is When patients are admitted we carry out a barriers to discharge meeting within the initial 72 hour admission, this informs us that a patient may have housing issues or no fixed abode.

Discharge plans are focussed around those barriers and include safeguarding elements for onward care, AMHP's will identify Safeguarding and Self Neglect issues when undertaking a MHA assessment and our social care teams will undertake a Care Act assessment as part of their involvement when a patient is referred.

A patient discharge is planned to be inclusive of onward placement and if street homeless will be discharged with a planned council appointment.

3.The number of nurses or support workers who support mental health patients regarding their housing while they are in the community. These could be housing officers, housing support workers, special housing nurses, or similar professions that are specialised in housing support.
