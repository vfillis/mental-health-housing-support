Dear Ms. Fillis,

Further to your recent request made under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, please see detailed below the Trust’s response:

1.    The number of nurses or support workers who support patients regarding their housing while they are inpatient in a mental health unit. These could be housing officers, housing support workers, special housing nurses, or similar professions that are specialised in housing support.
 
We do not have any staff whose specified role is housing related. An in-patient staff nurse acting as the patient’s Care Coordinator would liaise with housing associations or local authorities regarding housing issues.
 
2.    The protocol for discharging homeless patients or patients who face homelessness after their discharge. Please provide a document with the discharge policy or, if there is no document, please state what the protocol is.
 
Please see attached.
 
3.    The number of nurses or support workers who support mental health patients regarding their housing while they are in the community. These could be housing officers, housing support workers, special housing nurses, or similar professions that are specialised in housing support.
 
           Again, we do not have any staff whose specified role is housing related. A Community Mental Health Nurse acting as the patient’s Care Coordinator would liaise with housing associations or local        authorities regarding housing issues.
 

We would be grateful if you could take a minute to fill out our Freedom of Information Customer Satisfaction Survey (attached) and let us know about your experience.
