Dear Vanessa

Thank you for your email.  The Trust does not employ housing officers/nurses of any kind, as this is something that would be dealt with by Social Services.

As the Trust is not commissioned to provide such a service, we are unable to provide you with any further information regarding this request.


Kind regards
