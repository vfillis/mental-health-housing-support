# Freedom of Information requests about dedicated housing support staff 

I sent FOIs to 51 NHS Trusts. 

## Content of the FOI request

Dear Sir or Madam, 

My name is Vanessa Fillis and I am a freelance journalist. 

I would like to request, under the freedom of information act, the following information for adult mental health services in [name of the trust]. 

1.	The number of nurses or support workers who support patients regarding their housing while they are inpatient in a mental health unit. These could be housing officers, housing support workers, special housing nurses, or similar professions that are specialised in housing support. 

2.	The protocol for discharging homeless patients or patients who face homelessness after their discharge. Please provide a document with the discharge policy or, if there is no document, please state what the protocol is. 

3.	The number of nurses or support workers who support mental health patients regarding their housing while they are in the community. These could be housing officers, housing support workers, special housing nurses, or similar professions that are specialised in housing support. 

If it is not possible to provide the information requested due to the information exceeding the cost of compliance limits identified in Section 12, please provide advice and assistance, under the Section 16 obligations of the Act, as to how I can refine my request. If you can identify any ways that my request could be refined, I would be grateful for any further advice and assistance.

If you have any queries, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me via email and I will be very happy to clarify what I am asking for and discuss the request. My details are outlined below.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to your response.

Kind regards,
Vanessa Fillis
