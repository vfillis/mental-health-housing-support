Dear Madam,

Thank you for your request for information under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. Please accept our apologies for the delay in responding to your request.

In respect of questions 1 and 3, the Trust does not hold exact data: the total number with a specific job title in the Trust relating to Housing is 4 however it is known that other professionals support patients, without this job title, with housing related matters.

The Trust's Discharge policy the Trust considers this to be exempt from disclosure under s. 21 FOIA as being information reasonably accessible via other means, specifically the Trust's website: https://focus.derbyshirehealthcareft.nhs.uk/corporate/policies-and-procedures/policies?search=1&sortBy=&sortDirection=&keywords=discharge&policy_category=&policy_ratification_group=

If you are unhappy in any way with the way in which your request has been handled, please do not hesitate to contact the FOI enquiries team again in the first instance or, alternatively, the Trust has an internal complaints procedure through which you can raise any concerns you might have.

If you remain dissatisfied you can apply to the Information Commissioner who will consider whether the Trust has complied with its obligations under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and can require the Trust to remedy any problems.
