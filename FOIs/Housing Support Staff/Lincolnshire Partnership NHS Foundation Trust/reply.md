Dear Vanessa

Thank you for your FOI request as detailed in your email below.  Lincolnshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust respond as follows:

The Trust is commissioned to provide care and treatment for a local population of some 718,800 people, as well as specialist services for people who live in other areas of the East Midlands.  We are focused on helping people towards recovery, enabling them to live well in their community as much as possible.   The Trust employees approximately 2,500 members of staff across many disciplines of mental health, learning disability and social care.  The Local Authority is the responsible body for social care and housing.  Where a patient in receipt of care and treatment from this Trust is identified as requiring support with accommodation/housing, clinical teams will work with the patient to provide information and contact details of the responsible authority.  In the case of specialist residential placements as direct consequence of a person's mental health need, clinical staff employed by the Trust across a range of specialism, qualification and role, both in inpatient units and community services, will work with patients and their carers  to appropriately source and facilitate  specialist placements, according to the individual's need. For patients of no fixed abode, the Trust policy states:

 "...the council responsible for the patient is the council whose area they reside. This is irrespective of whether the patient lives on the streets or in a hostel. Under the Homelessness Reduction Act 2017 if clinical staff identify any patients who they think may be homeless, or may be at risk of homelessness, the local authority must be notified so appropriate support can be provided.."

All Trust policy documents are in the public domain and can be accessed via the Trust's website.  To assist, the Trust's Clinical Care policy can be accessed via the following link and information relating to discharge planning into the community is found in section 13.6.
