FOI21-5307 Request regarding housing support
Thank you for your recent Freedom of Information request on the above subject. We have completed our search for information and the details are as follows:
 
Black Country Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust was formed in April 2020 as a result of a merger between Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (BCPFT) and Dudley & Walsall Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust (DWMH) therefore you will notice that for question two there is two sets of answers for your request for both legacy Trusts.
 
1.    The number of nurses or support workers who support patients regarding their housing while they are inpatient in a mental health unit. These could be housing officers, housing support
workers, special housing nurses, or similar professions that are specialised in housing support. The Trust does not have these roles. All staff will help to facilitate discharge with the bed management team. This may involve working with social services, housing and other associated teams within the local authority.
 
2.    The protocol for discharging homeless patients or patients who face homelessness after their discharge. Please provide a document with the discharge policy or, if there is no document,
please state what the protocol is.  Work is on-going to harmonise policies so please refer to the legacy Black Country Partnership and DWMH policies below. These policies cover a 72hour patient follow-up, which covers patients with no fixed abode.
 
Standard Operating Procedure 2 (SOP 2) - 72 Hour Patient follow UP (72HFU (legacy Black Country)
 
The only exemptions from 72 hour follow up are:
• Patients who die within 72 hours of discharge may be excluded
• Where legal precedence has forced the removal of a patient from the country.
• Patients transferred or discharged to another NHS mental health inpatient ward or another Non NHS mental health hospital.
• CAMHS (Child and adolescent mental health services) are not included
 
On discharge, 72HFU contacts for Patients will not be completed on the day of discharge unless the Patient is of No Fixed Abode (NFA) with a high risk of potential non-attendance or if the Patient has confirmed their unavailability within the 72 hour period i.e. temporarily out of area / abroad
 
The 72HFU will be completed as follows:
·         Community Treatment Team / Complex Care Team will complete the 72HFU contact for all patients open to the teams or with an allocated care cluster of 8 and 11-17
·         Older Adults ECMHT’s will complete the 72HFU contact for all patients discharged from all older adult inpatient units.
·         Wellbeing service will complete the 72HFU contact for all patients open to the teams or with an allocated care cluster of 1-7
·         Early Intervention service (EIS) will complete the 72HFU contact for all Patients that are open to the service and both allocated or awaiting allocation of a care coordinator
·         Eating Disorders service (EDS) will complete the 72HFU contact for all Patients that are open to the service and both allocated or awaiting allocation of a care coordinator
·         CHTT will complete the 72HFU contact for all patients referred to the CHTT on discharge regardless of allocated care cluster within a 48 hour period

·         Inpatient ward will complete the 72HFU contact by telephone for all patients who are discharged or transferred to an out of area bed or service regardless of allocated care cluster. A telephone call to the Patient will be undertaken to confirm that they have been seen for 72HFU
 
Where the patient is NFA, all attempts must be made to contact patients for 72HFU based on information provided regarding staying at temporary addresses family or friends/ hostels/B&B etc.
