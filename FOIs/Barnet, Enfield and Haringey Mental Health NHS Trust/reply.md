Dear ,
 
Please find attached the response to your FOI request of 4 March.
What our Informatics Team have been able to report on is adult clients who had their latest accommodation status updated in the periods requested and the same based on client on CPA.
 
Our Informatics teams could only extract Section 117 data to 2012, not for the period you requested. We are trying to understand the cause of this and resolve it currently and will update you on this aspect when we can.
 
Kind regards
