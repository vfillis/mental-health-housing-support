# Data analysis

## Available data 
NHS Digital publishes [Mental Health Services Monhtly Statistics](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/mental-health-services-monthly-statistics). 

I downloaded the CSVs from April 2019 to January 2021 (latest available data) and merged them using the command line (cat *.csv > MHSDS2019to2020.csv) _after navigating with “cd” to the folder containing the CSVs. 

I then continued in R.

I analysed the data over time, but whenenver there was no change (which was mostly the case) I visualised the latest available data/only used the latest available data in my reporting instead of looking at the measures over time.

## Bed occupancy
